# Bank Management Systems
Ever wondered how banks operate and how ATMs precisely dispense funds from your account? The intricate systems behind these everyday transactions are fascinating examples of modern software engineering and data management. In this project, we delve into the world of Bank Management Systems using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++ to unravel these mysteries.

Bank Management Systems are complex software solutions designed to handle the various aspects of banking operations, such as account management, transaction processing, and customer service. These systems ensure that customers can seamlessly access their accounts, make deposits and withdrawals, and manage their finances securely.

The project focuses on implementing a basic Bank Management System with features like account login, secure transactions, and ATM management along with user interactions. 
In this C++ project, I gained insights into the core functionalities that drive banking operations, understand the importance of data security, and see how OOP principles facilitate the creation of scalable and maintainable software.
